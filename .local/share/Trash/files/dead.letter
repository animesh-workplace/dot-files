Subject: editor saved ``/home/nsm/.zshrc''
You were editing the file "/home/nsm/.zshrc"
at <Sat Sep  5 16:45> on the machine ``BrainiacII''
when the editor was killed.

You can retrieve most of your changes to this file
using the "recover" command of the editor.
An easy way to do this is to give the command "vi -r /home/nsm/.zshrc".
This method also works using "ex" and "edit".
